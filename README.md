# Compose first launch flick

I've noticed some issue with Compose MP flickering on first launch from a clean install.

Subsequent launches work just fine.

The problem already existed previously, but it was more noticeable/easier to reproduce when bumping to Compose 1.7.0.

A background with gradient/non-default-color background also makes the it easier to notice.
